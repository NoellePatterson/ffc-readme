# Fall Pulse Flow

The fall pulse flow describes a peak in the annual hydrograph created by the first significant increase in flow following dry season low flows. The fall pulse flow is the first date between October 1st to December 15th in which flow exceeds a pulse threshold, which is defined as twice the magnitude of the previous dry seasonâ€™s base flow or 1 cfs, whichever is greater. This pulse flow often takes the form of a storm event that introduces a rapid input of flow into the stream system. The fall pulse typically occurs each year but may not occur in some years depending on climate conditions. The metrics calculated for fall pulse include the timing, magnitude, and duration of the fall pulse flow event.
