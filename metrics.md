# Metrics

The FFC calculates metrics describing ecologically relevant components of the annual streamflow hydrograph. The metrics are organized into four seasonally-based functional flow components, in addition to two summary metrics \(average annual flow and coefficient of variation\) calculated for each water year. The FFC metrics are listed below.

#### Annual

* Average annual flow
* Coefficient of variation

#### Fall Pulse Flow

* Pulse magnitude
* Pulse timing
* Pulse duration

#### Wet Season

* Magnitude
* Timing
* Duration

#### Peak Magnitude Flows

Each of the following metrics is calculated annually for individual high flows that exceed 10-year, 5-year, and 2-year recurrence intervals of annual peak flows across the period of record:

* Magnitude
* Duration
* Frequency

#### Spring Recession Flows

* Magnitude
* Timing
* Duration
* Rate of change

#### Dry Season Baseflow

* Magnitude
* Timing
* Duration from start of dry season low flows until the start of the wet season of the next water year
