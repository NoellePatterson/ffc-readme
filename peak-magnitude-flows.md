# Wet Season - Peak Magnitude Flows

Peak magnitude flows describe the portion of the wet season period consisting of distinct high magnitude flow events, which are ususally a response to winter rainstorms. The following metrics are calculated for high flows that exceed the 10, 5, and 2 year recurrence intervals of annual peak flow, which correspond to 10%, 20%, 50% exeedance values.

* Magnitude
* Duration
* Frequency
