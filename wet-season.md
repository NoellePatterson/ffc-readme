# Wet-Season Baseflow

The wet season baseflow describes the period of the annual hydrograph with elevated flows due to either winter rainfall or spring snowmelt. Metrics used to describe the wet season baseflow describe the change in baseflow conditions from the dry season to the wet season, while peak flow conditions are described separately with wet season peak flow metrics. The wet-season baseflow is described with metrics for wet-season start timing, wet-season baseflow magnitude, and wet-season duration.
